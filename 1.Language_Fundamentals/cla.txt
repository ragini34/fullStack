In order to run the java file main method should be there.but we can compile,it is a starting point of java program,jvm will run the main method.
in place of args w can keep anything.
keywords having spl meaning in java meaning itself
keywords are also called
this are an reserved words
this are also building blocks of java program, java8 having 50 keywords
reserved literals is value that can be assigned to  variables(null,true,false)
main is a name of the method
identifier is a name in java programming to identify somthing like name,class
class name can be capital A-Z or small a-z
the first letter may in caps follow the camel case
while identifying the class we should not give the numbers
in between or at the end of identifier we can give the number but not starting identifiers
while developing the identifier we cannot use spl characters (only two spl characters are allowed[$ and _ ] we can keep anywhere in the identifier)
Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
while compiling cases like higher and lower case it will ignore due to window class
after generating the compiler to run in JVM the code The generated class will be case sensitive we should give the perfect class name
Empty java file can be develop and compiled,but we cannot run
we can run the file by just giving the .java name and we can compile
in same folder or src folder we cannot give More than one same 
Kernel,string,system inbuilt class but we can able to develop the identifier it will run the code possible but it is not recomended bcz it will lead to confusions
Runnable is an inbuilt interface name its not recommended bcz that leads to the confusion.
We can able to develop the identifier name with any length but not recommended and as a standerd we need keep small and simple with meaning

println is a method , ln stands for line
system is a class
within apair of double cote string value
console,command prompt,
main also one method 
args parameter 
print and println 
print will first print and next it will check whether it is ln or not
if it is ln then the courser will come to next line after printing its content
\n escape charecter we get an new line
\t tab space(4 spaces) depends on console or command prompt it sets to and with respect to java it sets to 8 spaces
space also an one charaecter
escape charecter will not disply

Literals

creating one folder of literals in that src and classes folder
def:literal is a value that can be assigned to a variable
in java we have 5 types of literals
1.string literal
2.integer literal(numbers)
3.floating point literals(decimal point)
4.charecter literal(inside a pair of single coute we have an chatecter)
5.boolean literal(true or false)
in double coute it takes as string
by removing the bracket cd ../ if i want to go back
cd ../../ it comes to the language fundamentals
cd ../../6.arithmetic_operator/src (we comes to the which we need)

in case of mode we get an remainder
in case of division we get an quatiant

datatypes:in order to specify the what type of data

in java we have 2 types of datatypes
1.primitive
2.non oremitive or reference type

byte,short,float,double,char,boolean,long,int


int i;  is an variable declaration of variable name
int name is identifier
= is left side of an assignment operator
i is an local variable limited to main method
10 is the intiger literal
in java every statement is end with semi colon
same var we can initialize many times no prblm
var is also an identifier
for each and evry data type 
in case of numbers it is an ranges 
byte range -128 to +127
short range = -32,768 to 32,768    (search in google data type ranges in java)

white spaces will be ignored by the compiler for readablity purpose we can use

by default the decimal value considerd as double values 
in case of float compalsary need to include f in upper case or lower case

in sop (print) also we can intialize the variable and printing also and declaration is not possible
string is non primitive, is a inbuilt calss,its also datatype

relational operators
/* */ it is an multi level comment

if block

what ever may there in if block resulting value must be in boolean,other than that it will give compilation error
it have opening and closing curly bracket,we can pass many number of statements due to brackets
if(true)//condition
if the condition writerning false it will not execute directly it will executes main method
we can keep some expression inside the if.

doubleAND operator

both the oparand must be resulting true


git coommnds

git status==> checking any modifications happened
git add . ==> adding the changes
git commit -m ==> message 
logical operator and if-else-condition ==>enter

git push -u origin main  (enter)



single AND & OR is also called bitwise
it will check both expression 

for one if block we can develop n number of else if block
else and if are seperate keywords
if block is true than there no need of exceuting else if block

else if must be true than only executes

any one is true than it wont continue to next else if block

in between else if we cannot keep else block

we should not keep any statement other than else if block in betwen else if and else

for loop is a basic loop
for is a keyword
for loop is having 3 parts
1.initialization section(executes only once)
; sepertor
2.checkimg condition(if condition true than only it enters to body,executes body)
3.increment or decrement()
keep on executes until it becomes condition false

23/8/23(programiz online java compiler)

for(i=0; false; i++)
if everytime the condition become false next statement becomes dead 

for(i=0;i<0;i++)
this statement may executes next line

for(i=0; (false==false);i++)
this statement will executes infinite
false&&false will 
directly if we pass false like boolean value we get an unreachable 

we cannot increment the boolean value like b++

if we pass or use variables there is chance of getting modify the variable
if i compare the variables esimply we get the 

after initializing variable we can declare any no.of print terms

initializer
iteration count is zero while 0th increment

continue statement

without executing competing continue than only 

labelling
within the nested loop by using continue or break we can use labeling

ternary operators

we can reduce the code                   hackersrank
ternary indicates thre parts
the condition true 1st executes not second will executes
depends on condition
? ==> wild charecter

if condition is true than before isto (:) condition will executes
if that is false than after the condition will executes


min is int type

enhanced for loop or for each loop

type of a loop
introduced in JDK1.5
for each iteration one element supplied to int type
array is an int type
to hold array elements we are declaring int type

to hold double value we declare double array

for loop compalsory we need to declare inside only


while loop
a kind of loop its an keyword
as long as condition true it keep on executing until the condition becomes false
